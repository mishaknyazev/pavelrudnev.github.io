title: Russian kids do crazy stuff to language

I've been meaning to jot this down for quite some time now but have so far struggled finding the right platform to do so. Hopefully this blog will do.[^1]

First off, a clarification is in order: this post's title is way too generic, and I'd like to narrow it down a bit. For obvious reasons I can't claim any knowledge of what *all* Russian kids do to language, nor that that stuff is crazier than any other infant's in their mother tongue. In what follows I restrict the domain of all Russian kids to just one, my 3-year-old daughter, Anastasia.

### Person, number and gender agreement ###

As is relatively well-known, Russian verbs display agreement with the subject in person, number and gender. But let's ignore number altogether and concentrate on the interaction of person and gender: *Ivan spal* ‘Ivan slept.<font style="font-feature-settings: 'smcp'">masc</font>’ minimally differs from *Maria spal-a* ‘Maria slept.<font style="font-feature-settings: 'smcp'">fem</font>’ in the presence vs. absence of the little *-a* morpheme corresponding to feminine gender agreement, even if the subject is a pronoun.[^2] Now, just until very recently but well past her third birthday, my daughter would systematically and consistently say *Papa, ja ne spal* ‘Daddy, I didn't sleep.<font style="font-feature-settings: 'smcp'">masc</font>.’ My initial thought was about her applying the masculine agreement pattern as a default strategy, yet she would also utter things like *Svinka propal-a* ‘The piggy disappeared.<font style="font-feature-settings: 'smcp'">fem</font>,’ having never erred unless she was unsure of the subject's gender. 

What does this tell us? What I think this tells us is that the first person feature on Anastasia's *ja* ‘I’ somehow supressed, or neutralised, the gender feature, too.

### Complementiser selection ###

The second thing I found peculiar about Anastasia's Russian is the way she'd use complementisers. A spoiler: she actually speaks English! Oh wait, no she doesn't, as she's strictly monolingual. Here's what I mean:

English uses the same word --- *if* --- to create emdedded questions like *I don't know if he's awake* and various sorts of conditional sentences, e.g. *I'll be sad if he's awake.* Many other languages don't (I'll give examples from some of the ones I can more or less speak): Dutch has *of* ‘whether’ and *als* ‘if’,[^3] Estonian has *kas* ‘whether’ and *kui* ‘if’, German has *ob* ‘whether’ and *wenn* ‘if’ etc. Now, Russian has that (e.g. *li* ‘whether’ and *jesli* ‘if’) and more, since unlike the other languages I've just listed, simply substituting one for the other is not sufficient to alter an embedded question into a conditional or vice versa. Let's consider an example:

[^2]: Gender agreement is only attested in the past tense, and apparently *ja* ‘I’ uttered by people of different sex carries different sets of features. Isn't that crazy from an Anglo-Saxon perspective? Not very exotic, by the way, as a similar pattern is attested in most Romance languages.

[^3]: There are, however, some dialects of Dutch where *als* ‘if’ can also be used either instead of or alongside *of* ‘whether’.
