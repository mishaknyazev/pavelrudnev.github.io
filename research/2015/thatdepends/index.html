  <p>In this talk I discuss a number of restrictions on sentential negation marking in Avar, a Northeast Caucasian language, and sketch a tentative analysis of the observed morphosyntactic facts as having a semantic basis. The two different negation markers (<em>-ro</em> and <em>-č'o</em>) are analysed, based on the proposal in Ramchand & Svenonius 2014, as taking complements of a different syntactic size and semantic type.</p>

  <p>
In particular, I show that the two negation markers attested in Avar differ in the type of semantic object they can compose
with: for the present and future tenses <em>-ro</em> combines with a Fin*P denoting a set of propositions, whereas past-tense negation utilises the biclausal predicational strategy.
  </p>

  <p>
The question why past tense forms cannot combine with <em>-ro</em> has remained unanswered. It remains to be seen whether the proposal made for
<em>-č’o</em> can be made compatible with the use of the present-tense negative copula/auxiliary <em>heč’o</em> as the auxiliary in analytic verb
forms.
