        		<h1>Research</h1>
		
				<p>I’m a linguist specialising in the interaction between syntactic structure and semantic interpretation. I got my PhD from the University of Groningen in 2015. My research to date has focused on anaphora, interrogatives, relative clauses, focus constructions, and negation. Languages I’ve worked on include Turkish, Avar (Northeast Caucasian) and Russian.</p>
			
        <p>My current research interests are at the intersection of the syntax and semantics of negation, disjunction and polarity, primarily in East Slavonic languages. </p>
